  abstract={Kohn–Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) is a powerful method to obtain key materials’ properties, but the iterative solution of the KS equations is a numerically intensive task, which limits its application to complex systems. To address this issue, machine learning (ML) models can be used as surrogates to find the ground-state charge density and reduce the computational overheads. We develop a grid-centred structural representation, based on Jacobi and Legendre polynomials combined with a linear regression, to accurately learn the converged DFT charge density. This integrates into a ML pipeline that can return any density-dependent observable, including energy and forces, at the quality of a converged DFT calculation, but at a fraction of the computational cost. Fast scanning of energy landscapes and producing starting densities for the DFT self-consistent cycle are among the applications of our scheme.}

  abstract={One of the main goals and challenges of materials discovery is to find the best candidates for each interest property or application. Machine learning rises in this context to efficiently optimize this search, exploring the immense materials space, consisting of simultaneously the atomic, compositional, and structural spaces. Topological insulators, presenting symmetry-protected metallic edge states, are a promising class of materials for different applications. However, further development is limited by the scarcity of viable candidates. Here we present and discuss machine learning–accelerated strategies for searching the materials space for two-dimensional topological materials. We show the importance of detailed investigations of each machine learning component, leading to different results. Using recently created databases containing thousands of ab initio calculations of 2D materials, we train machine learning models capable of determining the electronic topology of materials, with an accuracy of over 90%. We can then generate and screen thousands of novel materials, efficiently predicting their topological character without the need for a priori structural knowledge. We discover 56 non-trivial materials, of which 17 are novel insulating candidates for further investigation, for which we corroborate their topological properties with density functional theory calculations. This strategy is 10x more efficient than the trial-and-error approach while a few orders of magnitude faster and is a proof of concept for guiding improved materials discovery search strategies.}

Therefore, the quest for reproducible methods for the large scale synthesis, as well as the manipulation, characterization and deeper understanding of these structures is a very active field of research. We here report the production of nitrogen doped bilayer graphene in a fast single step (2.5 minutes), at reduced temperatures (760 C) using microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (MW-PECVD). Raman spectroscopy confirmed that nitrogen-doped bilayer structures were produced by this method. XPS analysis showed that we achieved control of the concentration of nitrogen dopants incorporated into the final samples. We have performed state of the art parameter-free simulations to investigate the cause of an unexpected splitting of the XPS signal as the concentration of nitrogen defects increased. We show that this splitting is due to the formation of interlayer bonds mediated by nitrogen defects on the layers of the material. The occurrence of these bonds may result in very specific electronic and mechanical properties of the bilayer structures.},

  abstract={Monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) in the 2H structural phase have been recently classified as higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs), protected by C3 rotation symmetry. In addition, theoretical calculations show an orbital Hall plateau in the insulating gap of TMDs, characterized by an orbital Chern number. We explore the correlation between these two phenomena in TMD monolayers in two structural phases: the concentrosymmetric 2H and the centrosymmetric 1T. Using density functional theory, we confirm the characteristics of 2H TMDs and reveal that 1T TMDs are identified by a Z4 topological invariant. As a result, when cut along appropriate directions, they host conducting edge states, which cross their bulk energy-band gaps and can transport orbital angular momentum. Our linear response calculations thus indicate that the HOTI phase is accompanied by an orbital Hall effect. Using general symmetry arguments, we establish a connection between the two phenomena with potential implications for orbitronics and spin orbitronics.},

  abstract={Crystalline Bi2Se3 is one of the most explored three-dimensional (3D) topological insulators with a 0.3 eV energy gap making it promising for applications. Its amorphous counterpart could bring to light new possibilities for large scale synthesis and applications. Using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we have studied realistic amorphous Bi2Se3 phases generated by different processes of melting, quenching, and annealing. Extensive structural and electronic characterizations show that the melting process induces an energy gap decrease ruled by growth of the defective local environments. This behavior dictates a weak stability of the topological phase to disorder, characterized by the spin Bott index. Interestingly, we identify the occurrence of topologically trivial surface states in amorphous Bi2Se3 that show a strong resemblance to standard helical topological states. Our results and methods advance the search of topological phases in 3D amorphous solids.},

However, in reality, the design of topological devices is hindered by a sensitivity against disorder and temperature. We study the topological properties of Na3Bi in the presence of intrinsic defects, investigating the robustness of the edge states and the resulting transport properties. We apply a recursive Green's function technique enabling the study of disordered systems with lengths comparable to experimentally synthesized materials, in the order of micrometers. We combine our findings to propose a topological insulator device, where intrinsic defects are used to filter the response of trivial bulk states. This results in a stable conductance throughout a large range of electronic temperatures, and controllable by a perpendicular electric field. Our proposal is general, enabling the design of various dual topological insulator devices.},

Over seven thousand force-curves are analyzed by a machine-learning approach to cluster the experimental data into types of cellulose-tip interactions. The molecular mechanisms for distinct types of cellulose–lignin interactions are revealed by molecular dynamics simulations of lignin globules interacting with different cellulose Iβ crystal facets. This unique combination of experimental force-curves, data-driven analysis, and molecular simulations opens a new approach of investigation and updates the understanding of cellulose–lignin interactions at the nanoscale.},

  abtract={Polyphenols are natural molecules of crucial importance in many applications, of which tannic acid (TA) is one of the most abundant and established. Most high-value applications require precise control of TA interactions with the system of interest. However, the molecular structure of TA is still not comprehended at the atomic level, of which all electronic and reactivity properties depend. Here, we combine an enhanced sampling global optimization method with density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations to explore the conformational space of TA assisted by unsupervised machine learning visualization and then investigate its lowest energy conformers. We study the external environment’s effect on the TA structure and properties. We find that vacuum favors compact structures by stabilizing peripheral atoms’ weak interactions, while in water, the molecule adopts more open conformations. The frontier molecular orbitals of the conformers with the lowest harmonic vibrational free energy have a HOMO–LUMO energy gap of 2.21 (3.27) eV, increasing to 2.82 (3.88) eV in water, at the DFT generalized gradient approximation (and hybrid) level of theory. Structural differences also change the distribution of potential reactive sites. We establish the fundamental importance of accurate structural consideration in determining TA and related polyphenol interactions in relevant technological applications.}

In this work, we use state-of-the-art density functional theory and recursive nonequilibrium Green's functions methods to study the effect of disorder on the electronic transport of long nanoribbons, up to 157 nm, as a function of vacancy concentration. In narrow nanoribbons, a finite-size effect gives rise to hybridization between the edge states erasing topological protection. Hence, even small vacancy concentrations enable backscattering events. We show that the topological protection is more robust for wide nanoribbons, but surprisingly it breaks down at moderate structural disorder. Our study helps to establish some bounds on defective bismuthene nanoribbons as promising candidates for spintronic applications.}
