In addition, theoretical calculations show an orbital Hall plateau in the insulating gap of TMDs, characterized by an orbital Chern number. We explore the correlation between these two phenomena in TMD monolayers in two structural phases: the concentrosymmetric 2H and the centrosymmetric 1T. Using density functional theory, we confirm the characteristics of 2H TMDs and reveal that 1T TMDs are identified by a Z4 topological invariant. As a result, when cut along appropriate directions, they host conducting edge states, which cross their bulk energy-band gaps and can transport orbital angular momentum. Our linear response calculations thus indicate that the HOTI phase is accompanied by an orbital Hall effect. Using general symmetry arguments, we establish a connection between the two phenomena with potential implications for orbitronics and spin orbitronics.","tags":[],"title":"Connecting Higher-Order Topology with the Orbital Hall Effect in Monolayers of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bruno Focassio","Michelangelo Domina","Urvesh Patil","Adalberto Fazzio","Stefano Sanvito"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"5111427414226fa3a1c70308dd9dbb79","permalink":"https://bfocassio.github.io/publication/2023-01-01_linear_jacobi-legend/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023-01-01_linear_jacobi-legend/","section":"publication","summary":"Kohn–Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) is a powerful method to obtain key materials’ properties, but the iterative solution of the KS equations is a numerically intensive task, which limits its application to complex systems. To address this issue, machine learning (ML) models can be used as surrogates to find the ground-state charge density and reduce the computational overheads. We develop a grid-centred structural representation, based on Jacobi and Legendre polynomials combined with a linear regression, to accurately learn the converged DFT charge density. This integrates into a ML pipeline that can return any density-dependent observable, including energy and forces, at the quality of a converged DFT calculation, but at a fraction of the computational cost. Fast scanning of energy landscapes and producing starting densities for the DFT self-consistent cycle are among the applications of our scheme.","tags":[],"title":"Linear Jacobi-Legendre Expansion of the Charge Density for Machine Learning-Accelerated Electronic Structure Calculations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["F Crasto de Lima","Bruno Focassio","RH Miwa","A Fazzio"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"ab99ad0b04559e2a02d0d921eb35e6cd","permalink":"https://bfocassio.github.io/publication/2023-01-01_topological_insulati/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023-01-01_topological_insulati/","section":"publication","summary":"Transition metal dichalcogenides have been the subject of numerous studies addressing technological applications and fundamental issues.

Extensive structural and electronic characterizations show that the melting process induces an energy gap decrease ruled by growth of the defective local environments. This behavior dictates a weak stability of the topological phase to disorder, characterized by the spin Bott index.

In narrow nanoribbons, a finite-size effect gives rise to hybridization between the edge states erasing topological protection. Hence, even small vacancy concentrations enable backscattering events. We show that the topological protection is more robust for wide nanoribbons, but surprisingly it breaks down at moderate structural disorder.

Machine learning rises in this context to efficiently optimize this search, exploring the immense materials space, consisting of simultaneously the atomic, compositional, and structural spaces. Topological insulators, presenting symmetry-protected metallic edge states, are a promising class of materials for different applications. However, further development is limited by the scarcity of viable candidates. Here we present and discuss machine learning–accelerated strategies for searching the materials space for two-dimensional topological materials. We show the importance of detailed investigations of each machine learning component, leading to different results. Using recently created databases containing thousands of ab initio calculations of 2D materials, we train machine learning models capable of determining the electronic topology of materials, with an accuracy of over 90%. We can then generate and screen thousands of novel materials, efficiently predicting their topological character without the need for a priori structural knowledge. We discover 56 non-trivial materials, of which 17 are novel insulating candidates for further investigation, for which we corroborate their topological properties with density functional theory calculations. This strategy is 10x more efficient than the trial-and-error approach while a few orders of magnitude faster and is a proof of concept for guiding improved materials discovery search strategies.","tags":[],"title":"Machine Learning for Materials Discovery: Two-Dimensional Topological Insulators","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bruno Focassio","Gabriel Ravanhani Schleder","Marcio Costa","Adalberto Fazzio","Caio Lewenkopf"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"4265ebd25b357dbe1050a8765187a00b","permalink":"https://bfocassio.github.io/publication/2021-01-01_structural_and_elect/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-01-01_structural_and_elect/","section":"publication","summary":"We investigate the structure and electronic spectra properties of two-dimensional amorphous bismuthene structures and show that these systems are topological insulators.

Therefore, the quest for reproducible methods for the large scale synthesis, as well as the manipulation, characterization and deeper understanding of these structures is a very active field of research. We here report the production of nitrogen doped bilayer graphene in a fast single step (2.5 minutes), at reduced temperatures (760 C) using microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (MW-PECVD). Raman spectroscopy confirmed that nitrogen-doped bilayer structures were produced by this method. XPS analysis showed that we achieved control of the concentration of nitrogen dopants incorporated into the final samples. We have performed state of the art parameter-free simulations to investigate the cause of an unexpected splitting of the XPS signal as the concentration of nitrogen defects increased. We show that this splitting is due to the formation of interlayer bonds mediated by nitrogen defects on the layers of the material. The occurrence of these bonds may result in very specific electronic and mechanical properties of the bilayer structures.","tags":[],"title":"Characterization of Nitrogen Doped Graphene Bilayers Synthesized by Fast, Low Temperature Microwave Plasma-Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Elucidating cellulose–lignin interactions at the molecular and nanometric scales is an important research topic with impacts on several pathways of biomass valorization. Here, the interaction forces between a cellulosic substrate and lignin are investigated. Atomic force microscopy with lignin-coated tips is employed to probe the site-specific adhesion to a cellulose film in liquid water. Over seven thousand force-curves are analyzed by a machine-learning approach to cluster the experimental data into types of cellulose-tip interactions. The molecular mechanisms for distinct types of cellulose–lignin interactions are revealed by molecular dynamics simulations of lignin globules interacting with different cellulose Iβ crystal facets. This unique combination of experimental force-curves, data-driven analysis, and molecular simulations opens a new approach of investigation and updates the understanding of cellulose–lignin interactions at the nanoscale.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"713614faa6d3cd159307012fae7e2f81","permalink":"https://bfocassio.github.io/project/pub2/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/pub2/","section":"project","summary":"Application of data analysis and machine learning on experimental data.

To address this issue, machine learning (ML) models can be used as surrogates to find the ground-state charge density and reduce the computational overheads. We develop a grid-centred structural representation, based on Jacobi and Legendre polynomials combined with a linear regression, to accurately learn the converged DFT charge density. This integrates into a ML pipeline that can return any density-dependent observable, including energy and forces, at the quality of a converged DFT calculation, but at a fraction of the computational cost.

Machine learning rises in this context to efficiently optimize this search, exploring the immense materials space, consisting of simultaneously the atomic, compositional, and structural spaces. Topological insulators, presenting symmetry-protected metallic edge states, are a promising class of materials for different applications. However, further development is limited by the scarcity of viable candidates. Here we present and discuss machine learning–accelerated strategies for searching the materials space for two-dimensional topological materials. We show the importance of detailed investigations of each machine learning component, leading to different results. Using recently created databases containing thousands of ab initio calculations of 2D materials, we train machine learning models capable of determining the electronic topology of materials, with an accuracy of over 90%. We can then generate and screen thousands of novel materials, efficiently predicting their topological character without the need for a priori structural knowledge. We discover 56 non-trivial materials, of which 17 are novel insulating candidates for further investigation, for which we corroborate their topological properties with density functional theory calculations. This strategy is 10× more efficient than the trial-and-error approach while a few orders of magnitude faster and is a proof of concept for guiding improved materials discovery search strategies.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"bfb03a6b09df622a7027650da106888e","permalink":"https://bfocassio.github.io/project/pub3/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/pub3/","section":"project","summary":"Data mining.
